        <h1>Attack on Titan an Evolution Critique</h1>
        <h2>By</h2>
        <h2>Theodoro Gasperin Terra Camargo</h2>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin, a popular manga series written by Hajime Isayama in 2009 that was later introduced as an anime in 2016. The story portrays a society isolated from the outside world by three curtain walls that protect the human race against their natural predator, Titans. In this society, it is believed that the last human population lies within these walls. However as the plot progresses, the main characters and the reader discovers that the human race has not became extinct in the outside world, and that beyond the walls lies a world divided into two types of Humans: Those descend from Ymir Fritz with the trait of being able to become titans Eldians, and those without Marleyans.</p>
        <p>The setting of this series tells a story, 100 years before the plot, about the King Karl Fritz that disillusioned with his Titan powers bestowed to him, lead his nation Eldia downfall by creating a rebellion by the subdue rival nation Marley. He then takes part of his people to the island Paradis and creates three walls made of titans: Wall Maria, Wall Rose, and Wall Sina. He then erases his people's memory of the outside world and creates a new history. However, a few families have the ability of not being affected by his power and remember the truth. From there we are brought back to the present one hundred years after this event. On a small city on the outer curtain wall, an attack from the titans takes place and destroy the city and breaks the wall, as consequence humanity loses a large portion of its farm land and people. </p>
        <p>The story follows three main characters as humanity wages war against the titan treat. From their young age and the massacre of their city through their military service as part of the scout regiment. The three: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are put into trials and battles as the leaders of the scout regiment search for truth about the titans. Eren possess the power to become a Titan and because of that he is a important military asset and an important piece to regain wall Maria. As such many political and military battles takes against the government and the hidden enemy.</p>
        <p>This critique will focus on the evolutionary concepts that can be applied to Hajime Isayama’s work and their accuracy. As well as some creative assumptions made by me to scientifically justify the universe created by the author. On this paper, I will aboard the coevolution relationship between titans and humans, some main concepts of natural selection, mechanisms of inheritance, biological repercussions of creating a colony on an island, population size and evolution, and how scientific misconceptions can affect the world we live in.</p>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>The series portrays a somewhat accurate predator prey interaction and asymmetrical coevolution. It can seem that there is selection pressure on both populations. These pressures create adaptations and counter adaptations respectively. For humans, individuals are selected for intelligence to survive the titan predation. Humans have created technology in the form of special types of gear and weapons to survive outside the walls. For titans, individuals are selected for behavior. There are two different type of Titans. Those who show a determined behavior when hunting its prey, and those who show a non-predetermined  behavior and are call “Abnormals” in the series. </p>
        <p>The abnormal titans have much more success when hunting than the normals titans, from this it could be inferred that they would more likely survive and pass their genetic information to the next generation. Therefore, a strong directional selection pressure for behavior on the population of titans can be seen. However, the series shows that abnormals are a small percentage of the overall titan population and don't seem to be growing in number. Because they are not growing in number, it implies a small or no selection pressure. This is fallacious considering that predator prey interactions in the wild show both species being selected for some adapted trait.</p>
        <p>But Titans do not follow the rules of natural selection. A population is limited  by the resources available in its environment like food, water, shelter, and others as Thomas Malthus noted and later inspired Darwin’s work. Titans are, clearly, not limited by food availability. Because, after they eat and are full, they simply regurgitate back their prey (humans). Another point of conflict is the lack of reproduction between individuals. Titans do not have any reproductive system. If there is no reproduction, the individuals that survive are not capable of passing their genes to the next generation, because there is no next generation. </p>
        <p>But when we put into consideration that titans are actually humans that carry a trait that allow them to be transformed (as revealed later in the series), we could consider this as a maladaptive trait and a form of genetic disorder. Maladaptive traits are detrimental to overall fitness of the individual, that is they lower the ability to pass their genes to the next generation. Maladaptive traits can be sometimes consider deleterious mutation. That is mutations that negative impact the survivorship  of individual and are usually eliminated through natural selection.  However, if they are linked to another adaptive gene or they have incomplete penetrance, like the titan case, they can be passed to the next generations. The titan allele has incomplete dominance and is only expressed when the organism is injected with titan fluid (whatever that is). Therefore, it is not impossible that this mutation could have persisted in the human population like we can see with many other genetic disorders like Hemophilia. The obvious biological disadvantages of this disorder are not being able to reproduce once the individual has become a titan, and the hole hunting members of your own species (just because it is the only thing a titan likes to do), that definitely affect overall fitness. </p>
        <p>From the two phenotypes of humans on Attack on Titan it can be inferred that a mutation occurred in the “Titan gene” (as I am gonna call it) creating two alleles. It could also be assumed that the Titan allele (as I am gonna call it) is probably dominant over the normal allele because all the Eldians (descendants of Ymir the first Titan) carry the ability to transform into a titan (or are assumed to be able to transform as we don't have enough information to assess whether all the eldians are able to transform or not). If the gene follows normal mendelian inheritance, the Hardy Weinberg principle could explain the higher genetic frequency of the dominant allele even though it is impossible to achieve the requirements in the wild to have such equilibrium. It could also be that the titan allele is recessive like many other genetic disorders and the genetic frequency of Paradis human population could be explained in another way. These are all far stretch assumptions as the series does not show what happens from heterozygous crosses or any type of crosses whatsoever. </p>
        <p>If we consider that the titan allele is a recessive allele, the genetic frequency on the island can also be explained by the Founder effect, a type of population bottleneck. This occured when King Karl Fritz formed a human colony from a small sample of his people. It could be postulated that the the titan gene could be considered a founder mutation, a rare mutation in one or more of the founder members over represented in the founder population. In addition, the genetic frequency on Paradis is very different from the mainland with only very few Asian individuals represented by Mikasa and Captain Levi, no dark skin color, and the absolute majority of individuals caucasians. These are normal when a small sample of large population is taken because, by random luck, the different ratios of alleles are chosen and therefore the overall genetic frequency of the founder population differs greatly from the origin population. The series explains that asian individuals were persecuted because they retained the memories erased by King Karl. This could possibly lower the genetic diversity in the population even more or be the cause of such low genetic diversity in the first place concerning this allele frequency (the asian phenotype). </p>
        <p>Under the curtain wall it could be assumed that genetic drift was the main factor driving evolution, before the fall of wall Maria, as there were little to none selection pressures in the form of predation inside the walls for one hundred years and the population was relatively small. After the fall of the first wall, humans were hunted and on the effort to amenize hunger the government launched a campaign to “retake wall Maria”. A strong selection pressure probably took place on those individuals, and natural selection was the main drive of evolution for that time period.</p>
        <p>Attack on titan references eugenics and social darwinism with a representation of the nazi fascist period as the nation of Marley. On the series the Eldians at the continent are called Devils because they are descendants of Ymir who supposedly did a deal with the Devil to gain her titan powers, and are thought to be an inferior race by the Marleyans. They are subdue to abuses at concentration camps, prohibit to bread with non Eldians, and used in the front line of battles as expendables soldiers. The series abords the concept of race on human beings but does not justify racism on pseudo scientific argument. However, it does give some justification of Merleyans’ superiority over Eldians on religious grounds.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Since the first manga chapter published in 2009, Attack on titan has become one of the most prominent works in its field, having sold over 100 million tankobon copies worldwide, and being one of the best-selling mangas in the world. Its audience is composed mostly of male individuals ranging from adolescents to young adults. The genre of this series is mostly fantasy and there are a few aspects of evolution that can be misportrayed by the author, but overall sensei Hajime Isayama tries to create a very accurate world and society based on our own. Some evolutionary concepts can be applicable to certain extent on this series like coevolution, predator/prey interaction, genetic drift, and the founder effect that could provide some scientific background to some of the universe created by Hajime Isayama even with inaccuracies. Because the genre is a fictional fantasy set on a fictional world and the audience is more mature, I believe that the evolutionary concepts (applicable to this artwork) influence accurate understanding to the audience despite some misconceptions . Furthermore, by abbording topics like racism on its work, the author draws attention to the consequences of applying misinformed race concepts into society.</p>
        <p>Evolution misconceptions and others misconceptions for that matter enter the public mind from popular artworks like movies, books, and mangas. Once misconceptions have entered people’s mind it takes generations to take it out with education. There are still flat earthers walking around even 500 years after Galileo. These misconceptions can be awfully danger when taught at earlier ages, and pointed at particular groups. The power of popular cultural works is much stronger today because of globalization and the advances of internet than 70 years ago. Imagine if the Nazis had social media like today instead of printed paper and the radio, and still the Nazi propaganda reverberates today through neo nazi groups. Therefore, it is important for artworks like these to represent accurate scientific concepts so that we can avoid spreading fallacies throughout our society and influence the world we live in positively.</p>
